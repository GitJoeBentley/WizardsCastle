# WizardsCastle
This C++ program is an implementation of the original Wizard's Castle game by Joseph Power in 1980.  I used the 
specifications posted by Brian "Beej Jorgensen" Hall (https://github.com/beejjorgensen/Wizards-Castle-Info/blob/master/doc/wizards_castle_spec.md)
and attempted to follow closely the original design.
